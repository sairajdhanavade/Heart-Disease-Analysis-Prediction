# Heart Disease Analysis & Prediction 🩺❤️‍🔥
This project utilizes a real-world clinical dataset to analyze and predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients. It is designed for researchers and data scientists to practice exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and binary classification modeling. 
## 🚀 Key Features
* Target: Binary classification (Presence vs. Absence of heart disease).
* Data Type: Multivariate clinical measurements (numerical and categorical).
* Applications:
   * 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find risk factors.
   * 🔍 Feature Importance to understand which medical indicators matter most. 
## Dataset Description
Each row represents a unique patient 👤. The dataset includes various medical indicators used by clinicians to diagnose cardiovascular health
Column Descriptions (Data Dictionary)
##  Column Name	--- Description
* Age --- Age of the patient (in years)
* Sex	--- Gender of the patient (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
* Chest pain type --- Type of chest pain:
                      | 1 = Typical angina
                      | 2 = Atypical angina
                      | 3 = Non-anginal pain
                      | 4 = Asymptomatic
* BP --- Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
* Cholesterol ---	Serum cholesterol level (mg/dL)
* FBS over 120	Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (1 = True, 0 = False)
* EKG results ---	Resting electrocardiogram results:
                   | 0 = Normal
                   | 1 = ST-T wave abnormality
                   | 2 = Left ventricular hypertrophy
* Max HR	--- Maximum heart rate achieved
* Exercise angina	--- Exercise-induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
* ST depression	--- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* Slope of ST ---	Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* Number of vessels fluro	--- Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy
* Thallium	--- Thallium stress test result (categorical medical indicator)
* Heart Disease	--- Target variable:
                  | Presence = Heart disease detected
                  | Absence = No heart disease
